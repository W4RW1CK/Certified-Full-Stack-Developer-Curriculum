        <ol>
          <li>Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Cook the mushrooms for <em>2â€“3 minutes</em>, or until they are golden-brown. Add the paprika and spinach, and stir so the spinach wilts. Remove the vegetables from the pan.</li>
          <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then pour the beaten egg into the pan. Cook, gently drawing in the sides of the omelette with a spatula, allowing the uncooked egg to fill the gaps and set.</li>
          <li>When the omelette is almost cooked, spoon the mushroom and spinach mixture back in, then flip over one half and slide onto a plate.</li>
          <li>Serve and Eat</li>
